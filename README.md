# gRPC based Implementation in Golang
> This project helps you in understanding gRPC based concepts and it's implementation  
> NOTE : Keep all proto files in $GOPATH/protofiles under their project names directory (best practices)

## Installation

```
mkdir $GOPATH/protofiles 

mkdir $GOPATH/protoFiles/grpc_tutorial
```

#### Copy this file :

__https://github.com/amulyakashyap09/golang_grpc/blob/master/users.proto__ **to** `$GOPATH/protoFiles/grpc_tutorial`

#### RUN this command : 

```protoc -I /protofiles /protofiles/grpc_tutorial/users.proto --gout=plugins=./grpc_tutorial```
* Above command will generate the **grpc_tutorial** named directory under **$GOPATH/src**
* With nested folder name **pb** which contains a file named **users.pb.go**
* This file is generated by proto compiler

```
cd $GOPATH/src/grpc_tutorial
mkdir client server
touch client/main.go server/main.go server/data.go
```

> Now you have your project strcuture ready.

##### Copy files to their respective directories : 

* __https://github.com/amulyakashyap09/golang_grpc/blob/master/client/main.go__ to **dir named client**
* __https://github.com/amulyakashyap09/golang_grpc/blob/master/server/main.go__ to **dir named server**
* __https://github.com/amulyakashyap09/golang_grpc/blob/master/server/data.go__ to **dir named server**

> Now we are done with project and its content.

## Usage

#### BUILD & EXECUTE SERVER : 

> Build the server : ` go install grpc_tutorial/server `

> Execute the server binary : `$GOPATH/bin/server`

#### BUILD & EXECUTE CLIENT :

> Build the client : ` go install grpc_tutorial/client `

> Execute the client binary : `$GOPATH/bin/client -o <int_value>` with options

#### Now after executing client you have to pass inputs over cli

* 1 sending metadata to server  |   `$GOPATH/bin/client -o 1`
* 2 Fetching User by ID  |   `$GOPATH/bin/client -o 2`
* 3 Fetch all users  |   `$GOPATH/bin/client -o 3`
* 4 Save user to file  |   `$GOPATH/bin/client -o 4`
* 5 Save all users to file  |   `$GOPATH/bin/client -o 5`

> And you'll see output everytime on the terminal when any command executes.
